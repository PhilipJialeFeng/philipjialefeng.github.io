title: "Triplet Exciton Management via Solid-state Interactions in Organic Semiconductors"
collection: teaching
type: "This is my PhD research project which was conducted at the University of Cambridge, Cavendish Laboratory, Optoelectronics group. I investigated a new family of organic light emitters known as carbene-metal-amides(CMAs). I used ultrafast spectroscopy and computational models to unveil the emission mechanisms of these highly-efficient and hybrid-type molecules."

During my PhD, I investigated the physics of light emission in a series of organometallic molecular rotors for use in state-of-art OLEDs. The aim is to understand the effects of solid-state interactions on triplet excitons, highlighting the diffusion process, the electrostatic interactions with surrounding molecules, the link between molecular conformations and photophysical properties, and heavy-atom effects by using various optical spectroscopy techniques combined with computational models. The intended application is the development of effcient and stable OLED light sources based on thin-film organic semiconductors, particularly in the blue spectral region.

<!-- The results have been published in three journal articles. The work discussing the effect of triplet diffusion and electrostatic interactions features in *[Advanced Functional Materials](https://philipjialefeng.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-environmental-control)*.
