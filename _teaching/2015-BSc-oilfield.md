<!-- Droplets of some oil, such as hexadecane, when being around the size of 10-30 $\micro$m, stablised by surfactant and slowly cooled down, can spontaneously undergo shape transformations and related self-emulsification, which means breaking down to smaller droplets by itself. In this project, I added fluorescence dye to the oil droplets and used optical microscope to monitor the shape changing. I found that the stability of droplets during shape transformation is related to the rotator phases formed between the oil and the water. I also investigated the minimum surfactant requirements for inducing self-shaping of oil droplets and competitive adsorption effects. My work from this project features in *[Soft Matter](https://philipjialefeng.github.io/publication/2022-08-25-mixedsurfactant)*.
