title: "Bi-excitonic Interactions in Singlet Fission and Triplet-Triplet Annihilation of Organic Molecules"
collection: teaching
type: "This is the project I conducted when I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science. I used time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, magnetic field effect on photoluminescence and computational modellings to reveal new insights into the mechanism and intermediate states in singlet fission and triplet-triplet annihilation."

Singlet fission (SF) and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) are two processes that can be harnessed to improve the efficiency of conventional inorganic solar cells, such as silicon, and to break the Shockley-Queisser limit on the efficiency of single-junction photovoltaics. However, the mechanism is still under debate, centering around the multi-excitonic states bridging the conversion between spin-singlet and spin-triplet excitons. The aim of this project is to reconcile the debate in previous literature and to establish a unified model to explain the intermediate states in SF and TTA.

If you want to learn more about the triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) and photochemical energy upconversion, you can read our perspective paper published in *[Journal of Materials Chemistry C](https://philipjialefeng.github.io/publication/2022-05-03-upconversionperspective)* and our review paper published in *[Annual Review of Physical Chemistry](https://philipjialefeng.github.io/publication/2023-01-25-photochemicalupconversion)*.
