I am a physicist with a broad range of experience, which spans from scanning tunneling microscope (STM) of the iron surface corrosion, to optical microscopy of oil-surfactant interface, to ultrafast spectroscopy of organic semiconductors.
I have a strong background in photophysics, spin-physics, spectroscopy, computations and simulations using programming languages. 
Below are some highlighted research projects I conducted.
