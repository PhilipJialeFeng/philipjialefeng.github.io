Professional Experience
======
* **Post-doctoral Research Fellow**, Sept 2021 - present
  * Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science, University of New South Wales (UNSW) node

Technical Skills
======
* **Programming languages and data analysis**
  * Python (advanced level) frequently used for large dataset analysis, data visualisations, and numerical simulations.
  * Familiar with machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence models.
  * Use MATLAB and R (intermediate level) for supplementary analysis.
* **Scientific knowledge for state-of-art technologies**
  * Deep understanding of organic semiconductors, especially the current OLED technology. Worked
with Samsung Display to develop and characterise novel organic light emitters.
  * Comprehensive knowledge about clean and renewable energy, particularly solar energy harvesting
using photovoltaics and mechanisms of breaking the effciency limit of solar cells.
  * Strong quantum physics background to analyse current quantum technologies, such as semicon-
ductors, quantum computers, quantum information, electron microscopes and laser.
* **Software**
  * Word, Excel, Power Point, LaTeX, Abode Photoshop, Origin.
  * Frequently use Adobe Illustrator and Blender to design and draw fgures for scientific publications.

<!-- * **Photophysics characterisations of organic semiconductors**
  * Strong expertise in steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopy, including cryogenic spectroscopy.
  * Optical and optoelectronic analyses of organic semiconductors.
  * Morphological and structural analyses of thin films, data interpretation and relate molecular properties to device performance.
* **Device fabrications and characterisations**
  * Vapour-deposited and solution-processed OLED device fabrications.
  * Knowledge of device physics and working principles.
  * Characterise device performance.
* **Computation**
  * Quantum chemistry calculations using density functional theory (DFT) of molecular properties using high performance computers.
  * Monte-Carlo simulations.
* **Graphical design**
  * Frequently use Adobe Illustrator and Blender to design and draw figures for scientific publications. -->

Transferable Skills
======
* **Leadership and collaboration**
Led 5 research projects and two review papers, involving 36 researchers from 17 different groups,
also collaborated in 4 research projects. All work published in top-tier journals.
* **Project and time management**
Plan projects in a timely manner and finished my PhD within 33 months with 3 first-author and
1 co-author publications. Received extremely positive feedback from two PhD viva examiners.
* **Communication and presentation**
Gave 2 invited talks, 5 oral presentations and 4 poster presentations in international conferences
and departmental seminars, where I successfully established collaborations with 5 research groups.
* **Organisation**
Organised 2019 Cavendish Laboratory, Optoelectronics group winter school (skiing trip plus daily
academic seminars) in Austria for five days, around 70 people.
